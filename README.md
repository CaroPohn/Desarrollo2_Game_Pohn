Hello, thank you for visiting my proyect: KitchenChaos!
This game was made in Unity with a lot of dedication. It's my first project on this engine, so it was a significant learning experience.

Currently, Kitchen Chaos is complete (although there may be future updates!). It features four perfectly playable levels, a menu with various settings, and very entertaining mechanics!
KitchenChaos is a platformer combined with a lot of cooking mechanics.

In the process, I applied various programming patterns such as Factory, Pool, and Strategy, aiming to maintain S.O.L.I.D code throughout the project. Additionally, I implemented several recent learnings, including creating a FSM (Finite State Machine), 
using coroutines, interfaces, scriptable objects and events in various places, all within Unity which I'm using for the first time for a personal project.


HOW TO PLAY:
Press WASD or LEFT STICK to Move.
Press SPACE or SOUTH BUTTON to Jump.
Press E or EAST BUTTON to Pick/Drop objects.
Press F or NORTH BUTTON to Cut the ingredients.
Press ESCAPE or WEST BUTTON to Pause/Unpause.


You have to pick the ingredients one by one and chop it in the chopping table. You have to press the cutting key multiple times to add progress.
Also after you minced the meat you have to cook it in the stove. Be careful! If you leave it for too long, it will burn.
Pay attention to the waiting orders to add all the correct ingredients to the plate. After that you have to deliver it into de order counter!
